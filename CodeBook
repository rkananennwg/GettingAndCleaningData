Code Book
This document describes the code inside run_analysis.R.

The code is splitted (by comments) in some sections:

Some functions to avoid code repetition and make the rest of code more clean.

fileJoin -> Used to build file paths, it concatenates strings using a slash as separator.

extractUciHarFile ->Extract a file from the zipped UCI HAR file.

uciHarDataFile-> Read dataset files from UCI HAR to given name and prefix. Know names are "train" and "test". Known prefixes are "X", "y" and "subject".

Examples:
UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
loadUciHarData

Loads data, labels and subjects from UCI HAR dataset to a data.frame. The returned data.frame contains a column Activity with labels integer codes, a column Subject with subjects integer codes and all other columns from data.

Merges test data and trainning data to allData
Indentifies the mean and std columns (plus Activity and Subject) to meanAndStdCols
Extracts a new data.frames with only those columns from meanAndStdCols.
Summarizes meanAndStdData calculating the average for each column for each activity/subject pair to meanAndStdAverages.
At this point the final data frame meanAndStdAverages looks like this:

> head(meanAndStdAverages[, 1:5], n=3)
  Activity Subject tBodyAcc.mean...X tBodyAcc.mean...Y tBodyAcc.mean...Z
1  WALKING       1         0.2773308       -0.01738382        -0.1111481

Writing final data to txt file

Creates the output dir if it doesn't exist and writes meanAndStdAverages data frame to the ouputfile.
